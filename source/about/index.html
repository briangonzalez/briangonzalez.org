  So yea, my name is Brian and I spend a lot of time writing code - primarily Javascript (Node, Ember, Vue, etc).
</p>

<p>
  I spend even more time thinking about how teams of software engineers can do their jobs more efficiently. In fact, I currently lead the front end team at <a href="https://dollarshaveclub.com" target="_blank">Dollar Shave Club</a> where I do just that.
</p>

<p>
  I adhere to th 80/20 principle. I listen to a lot of podcasts. I've read a fair amount of books
  (<a href="/books" v-link="{ path: '/books' }">here are some of my favs</a>). I've
  run 2 marathons. I got my masters degree from Norway (for free). I used to own a â€˜72 VW Bus.  I currently reside in Santa Monica, CA.
