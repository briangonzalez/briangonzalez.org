<p>Piggy-backing off a recent decision to <a href='/posts/fontprep-now-free'>make FontPrep free</a>, FontPrep is now 100% <a href='https://github.com/briangonzalez/fontprep'>open source software</a>.</p>

<p>Our hope is that the code will inspire and lead someone to build a bigger and better font converting app for OSX. Maybe in <a href='http://www.rubymotion.com/'>RubyMotion</a> or <a href='https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit'>node-webkit</a>, or others.</p>

<p>When we first built FontPrep, we spent the better 90% of our time figuring out how to produce bulletproof font files and CSS. It&#8217;s harder than you&#8217;d think. This left us little time to produce a user experience we&#8217;re fully happy with. This also left us little time to author maintainable code.</p>

<p>So dig into <a href='https://github.com/briangonzalez/fontprep'>FontPrep&#8217;s codebase</a>, ask <a href='http://twitter.com/brianmgonzalez'>questions</a>, learn from our efforts and mistakes, and keep on hacking.</p>
