<p><a href='http://dan.iel.fm/'>Dan Foreman-Mackey</a> has created such a neat tool: <a href='http://osrc.dfm.io/'>The Open Source Report Card</a>.</p>

<p>Check out <a href='http://osrc.dfm.io/briangonzalez'>my Open Source Report Card</a>. Some notables: I am a <strong>hump-day hero</strong>, which means I do most of my work mid-week, and I also am <strong>most productive in the morning</strong>.</p>

<p>Foreman-Mackey says it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;seemed like a good idea to provide a more complete set of global statistics summarizing the hacker personality of any GitHub user.</p>

<p>Noble goal my friend.</p>
