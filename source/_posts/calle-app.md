<p>I just built a little webapp for a coding challenge which finds nearby food trucks in San Francisco. It&#8217;s called <a href='http://briangonzalez.org/calle/'>Calle</a>, which means &#8220;street&#8221; in Spanish.</p>

<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s completely open source on <a href='https://github.com/briangonzalez/calle-app'>Github</a>.</p>
