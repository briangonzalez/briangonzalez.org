I built a proof-of-concept for using icon fonts for sprite animations. The result feels a little _too gif_ for my liking, but this is just a proof of concept. I could have added more frames to get a more fluid animation.

View the result on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/briangonzalez/details/hdHKm).

I've included all of the necessary font files (processed with [FontPrep](https://github.com/briangonzalez/fontprep)) and the .glyphs files (built using [Glyphs App](http://glyphsapp.com)).
