<p>Here&#8217;s a very nice flat user interface set by <a href='http://designmodo.com/'>DesignModo</a>. Would love to see more stuff like this.</p>

<p><strong><a href='http://designmodo.github.com/Flat-UI/'>Check it out</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Seems as if <a href='https://layervault.com/'>LayerVault</a> has issued a <a href='https://github.com/github/dmca/commit/735e17614cca63102b8414ed2846c3effbfe9535#commitcomment-2751021'>takedown notice</a> to DesignModo. Now the links are broken. I was able to get a zip file and upload it <a href='/uploads/FlatUI-Free.zip'>here</a>. Use at your own discretion.</p>
