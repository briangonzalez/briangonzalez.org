<p>All good things must come to an end. FontPrep v1 is no different.</p>

<p>FontPrep v1 worked by sending your fonts to a server for further processing and converting. In FontPrep v2+, we were able to bring the entire process to your machine.</p>

<p>In the coming days, we&#8217;ll be shutting off the API that powered FontPrep v1. Please upgrade as soon as possible to take <a href='http://briangonzalez.org/posts/whats-new-in-fontprep-v2'>advantages of the latest features</a>.</p>
