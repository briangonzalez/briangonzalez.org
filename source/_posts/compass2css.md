<p>Lately I&#8217;ve needed a quick &amp; easy way to view the output from some <a href='http://compass-style.org/reference/compass'>Compass</a> include statements.</p>

<p><a href='http://chriseppstein.github.com/'>Chris Eppstein</a> and the guys over at Compass and <a href='http://sass-lang.com/docs.html'>Sass</a> have created an easy abstraction to the ever-changing CSS spec. I created a handy little app which lets you see the CSS output from any Compass code.</p>
