This weekend was _full_ of new things:

- I dove in head first and switched to [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
- [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/) as my new code editing font of choice
- Got an Amazon Echo - I'll help build a Dollar Shave Club Skill this summer with the engineering team and some new interns
- I launched a new site: new design & new tech stack ([Hexo](https://hexo.io/), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), Github Pages)
- Game of Thrones S06E06
