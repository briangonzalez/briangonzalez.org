<p>I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgXhMc8M4X4" target="_blank" rel="external">Adventures in Elm by Jessica Kerr</a> and I was stuck for a while on the following idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My fingers work…I’d rather do a little more work with my fingers and less work with my brain because I want to be able to save my decision power for my actual business logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is that, due to the contraints of a statically typed language like Elm, you’re forced into writing code that your future self has an easier time reasoning about. I get it.</p>
<p>It’s this very notion which has led to a lot of shaming of Javascript as of late.</p>
<p>I, however, think the conversation is more nuanced.</p>
<p>As someone who enjoys mentoring new developers, the utililty of opening literally any browser and pressing <code>CMD + OPT + i</code> to invoke a REPL and tinker and prototype and explore cannot be understated. Javascript is fast, expressive, and it runs everywhere.</p>
<p>I do believe maintainability is crucial. However, shortening the path to gratification, <em>especially for new developers</em>, is invaluable.</p>
<h2 id="Your-Speed"><a href="#Your-Speed" class="headerlink" title="Your Speed"></a>Your Speed</h2><p><img src="your-speed.jpg" alt="Your Speed traffic sign" style="width: 200px;"></p>
<p>Consider the “Your Speed” traffic sign, which embodies the Evidence, Relevance, Consequences, and Action Feedback loop cycle concept – outlined <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/06/ff_feedbackloop/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The driver is immediately shown evidence that they’re speeding</li>
<li>It’s put into perspective by contrasting the speed limit</li>
<li>The driver is reminded about consquences – tickets, citations, etc.</li>
<li>The driver slows down as a results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Javascript is the “Your Speed” sign for young developers. With little ceremony – install steps, etc. – a developer is instantly injected into this feedback loop and they’re able to modify their behavior nearly real-time.</p>
